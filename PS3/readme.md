The method of jailbreaking your console depends specifically on what type of model it is.

If your console looks like this, you have a Fat PS3. These are the biggest and heaviest models, but come with the advantage that any and every one of these can be modded with full CFW (Custom Firmware). My recommendation is to update to Official 4.89 Firmware before jailbreaking it.

Slim PS3s are slighty smaller and lighter. Not all of these can be flashed off-the-bat.
If you have version 3.55 or lower, you're in luck. You can directly flash CFW. If your FW version is higher than 3.55, it has a chance of being incompatible.
To confirm this, check the back of your console, where it says CECH-XXXX. If it starts with CECH-20XX or CECH-21XX, then you can install CFW. If your model number is CECH-2500, then your console is eligible ONLY if the Manufacture Date on the rear of your console is BEFORE 2011 (Japan/USA consoles), or the Date Code contains a 0 or 9 (European Consoles).

The Super Slim PS3 is the newest, lightest, and smallest version of the PS3. All Super Slim models are CFW-incompatible.



What do I do if my console is not CFW-compatible?
You're not entirely out of luck. You can still use an exploit called HEN (Homebrew ENabler), which allows you to install applications and games, and un-signed codes. The only difference is that you need to run the HEN exploit every time your console is rebooted (so if you just turned it on, you need to run the exploit). The advantage of CFW is that once it's exploited, you don't need to run the exploit on every boot.
